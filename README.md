this is the beta of a precise monster hunter calculator damage average comparison for any blademaster weapon

For any that plays any monster hunter game, everyone have the constant question:"which weapon makes more damage?"
the problem is because the game show you information that makes usefull but in the practices is really ambiguous, you can see a raw damage,
the percent of chance to make a critic, the sharpness of a weapon and the value of the element damage, it seems simple, damage is damage, element is a plus and 
sharpness is for the weapon not bounce an a critic.

so the question is, which weapon is more strong? a great sword with hit combo with 1000 damage and blue sharp? or a lance with 500 damage and green sharp?
when you reed de ecuation that the game use to make damage is all clear and you can compare any weapon wint that datas and automatically can get the average damage and can compare 2 weapons
